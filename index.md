# Implement new OAuth Provider and refactor Google Sign-In
As a participant of the Google Summer of Code 2020 I helped Catrobat to implement new OAuth Provider (HWIIOAuthBundle) and refactor Google Sign-In. 
I also added a support for Facebook and Apple Log in. Now the users can easier login if they have already existing account on the other platforms like Google, Facebook and Apple.
## Contribution
Here is the description of the contribution of my workflow 
### Step 1 - Choose OAuth Provider
First of all I needed to decide which OAuth provider we should implement. After some research I decided for the HWIOAuthBundle since this bundle is widely used, popular and has a great documentation.
### Step 2 - Install and Configure HWIOAuthBundle
I installed and configured all files in order to get HWIOAuthWorking
### Step 3 - Add Apple Sign in Support
